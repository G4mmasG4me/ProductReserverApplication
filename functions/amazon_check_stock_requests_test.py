# form values
# amzn: get from form
# amzn-r: refer website / product url e.g. /dp/B08H95Y452
# field-keywords: captcha answer


# current problem
# only works on english speaking websites
# to work on all language website
# I need to check if it shows the price of the product or not
# If it shows the price, it means it's in stock
# If it doesn't show the price, it means it's out of stock+

# some amazon websites have product price with id="priceblock_ourprice"
# eg | <span id="priceblock_ourprice" class="a-size-medium a-color-price priceBlockBuyingPriceString">â‚¬17.99</span>

# others have higher elements with id="corePriceDisplay_desktop_feature_div"

# if i rely on availability message, then it's not going to work across different languages
# could create a list of all unavailable message across different languages
