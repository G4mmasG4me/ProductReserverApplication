MetaData1 Encoder and Decoder



amazon login in page
https://www.amazon.com/gp/sign-in.html


to buy products once the product is available
- make sure they session is signed into the amazon account, only need to do this once using selenium
- then create mulitple processes with all the order data, such as delivery adderss etc.
- then in each of those processes they will go to the amazon product website with the current session, logged in and then buy the product, filling in the form data with the order details.

above is the easiest solution so far

a more complex but faster solution would be to use requests to sign into amazon, this would require finding out the metadata1 algorithm so that I can insert the metadata value into the form, which will bypass the bot block.
